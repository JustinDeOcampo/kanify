Since there are more than 2,000 kanji characters a Japanese learner needs to learn to be deemed literate, we designed that a tool that helps users see how much progress they're making when it comes to reading kanjis. Through [WaniKani](http://wanikani.com), one of the most popular online Kanji learning platforms, users increase their kanji vocabulary through daily practice. Kanify enables Japanese learners to highlight the kanji they practice in WaniKani on any given web page.
